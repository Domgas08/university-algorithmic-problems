## Algorithmic Problems in C

This repository contains selected algorithmic problem solutions implemented in the C programming language as part of extra university coursework.

The focus of these problems is on:
- Algorithmic thinking and problem solving
- Dynamic programming
- Working with numerical constraints
- Clear and correct C implementations

### Contents

- **subset-sum/**  
  Determines whether a given number can be represented as the sum of some elements of an array and prints the elements forming the sum.

- **partition-array/**  
  Splits an array into two parts such that the difference between the sums of the parts is minimized.

- **base-conversion/**  
  Converts a number from base `x` to base `y` for `x < 37` and `y < 37`, supporting digits and letters (`0–9`, `A–Z`).

All programs are written in standard C and are intended for educational and learning purposes.
