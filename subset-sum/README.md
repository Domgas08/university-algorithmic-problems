## Subset Sum with Proof (C)

This program checks whether a given number `x` can be represented as the sum
of some elements from a given integer array.

If such a representation exists, the program prints the list of elements
whose sum equals `x`, thus providing a proof of the result.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Dynamic programming
- Subset sum problem
- Reconstruction of solution
- Array processing
